We'd love your help!

##### Here are the ways you can help:
- Work on the API in the `EXPERIMENTAL/api` folder
- Improvements on the knowledgebase search engine in the `EXPERIMENTAL/Assistant/knowledgebase/KB_API.py` search function are always welcome. Getting the most relevant facts is crucial to getting good responses.
- Add to the devices! The `EXPERIMENTAL/devices` folder contains code for all the different devices we plan to make using Charles. Currently, we have only the `pi_zero` device, which will be used to make a smart speaker like Amazon Echo or Google Home. Feel free to add more for your ideas!

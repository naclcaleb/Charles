# Charles - The Experimental Project
Thank you for checking out the experimental project!

This branch of the Charles repo is dedicated to a heavy upgrade to the Charles system. Here are some of the primary differences:
- The original Charles used a selective model chatbot system based on Dialogflow, while the upgrade uses a generatvie model handmade with Tensorflow
- The `master` branch version uses an infinite loop to run Charles, while this one uses the more efficient  snowboy wake word detection system 
- This upgrade includes an API that connects to the Hoogle token authentication system, allowing us to make smaller Charles devices with less processing power.
- There are a few more changes, but my best advice is just to look around and explore!

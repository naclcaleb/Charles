# Charles
To get your Charles up and running, download the zip file and extract it in a folder of your choice. 
Open up a terminal in the directory, and run:

sudo chmod +x install_dependencies.sh && sudo ./install_dependencies.sh

This will install all the Python libraries and other Linux packages you need to run the Python script.
